<span class="rnspan">Thanh Nguyen</span>
<span class="rdegspan">M.A.</span>, is a doctoral candidate in the Clinical Psychology program at the University of Massachusetts, Boston and a current APA Minority Fellowship Program fellow. She received her Bachelor’s of Arts in Psychology from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and her Master’s of Arts in Special Education from San Francisco State University. She also completed her Clinical Psychology master’s thesis, which examined early intervention service disparities among racial minority children with autism. Thanh’s clinical and research interests center on addressing health service inequities among ethnic minority children with developmental disabilities and their families, particularly those from low-income Southeast Asian refugee and immigrant communities. She has provided clinical services at Tufts’ Center for Children with Special Needs and Aspire Health Alliance, MA, with an emphasis on working with racial and ethnic minority children and families from underserved backgrounds (e.g., Vietnamese Americans). She is currently working on her dissertation proposal that will focus on understanding the process to which Vietnamese American families with children on the autism spectrum make meaning of being a family.
