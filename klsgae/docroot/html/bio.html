    <p>Karen L. Suyemoto, Ph.D. is Professor of Psychology and Asian American 
       Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Boston.  She received her B.S. in 
       Clinical Psychology and English from Tufts University in 1987 and her Ph.D. (1994) from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.  
       After completing her internship and postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco (Department of Psychiatry
       in the School of Medicine), she held Assistant Professor positions at Saint Mary's College of 
       Maryland (1995-1998) and Northeastern University (1998-2000) before moving to her current position.

    <p>Dr. Suyemoto's teaching, scholarship, and community coaction reflect her commitment to contributing to social justice 
      and empowering those who have been oppressed, marginalized, or silenced. Her courses focus on issues within her joint 
      disciplines related to racialization, culture, and diversity, with secondary foci on applications of psychology 
      and qualitative methods. With her research team, she focuses her scholarship on the processes of resisting 
      oppression from both privileged and marginalized statuses; on meanings, constructions, and operationalizations 
      of identities and concepts related to power and privilege; and on connections between research/theory and practice in 
      order to contribute to mental health and social justice.

    <p>Current research projects include: an ongoing project currently in data collection and preliminary analysis examining the 
      effects of racism for people of color and how taking action to resist or challenge racism personally or systemically may moderate the 
      negative psychological effects of experiencing racism; and a  project in collaborative development designing and 
      evaluating intervention workshops to address racism related stress for people of color. Previous publications and 
      presentations have focused on inter-minority race relations, training psychologists for cultural sensitivity, teaching 
      for transformation and social justice, and feminist applications and connections with multicultural understandings 
      in psychotherapy. Foci of current graduate students within her research team include effective services for promoting 
      Asian American mental health and well being; intersectionality, racism, and sexism for Asian American women; 
      intergenerational trauma for southeast Asian refugees; experiences of transracial/transnational adoptees; 
      and the development of ally stances and action.
