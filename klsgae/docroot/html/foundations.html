<div class="titlediv">Foundational Themes: Building Bridges for Social Justice</div>

     <p>In my work, I collaborate with students and professionals to dismantle the “armor of ignorance” that 
       sustains injustice. Together, we explore and validate the pain of discrimination. Simultaneously, 
       we engage in a difficult journey of coming to know the "other," to see ourselves within them and them 
       within us, to care for and about them, and to see and share the pain of injustice. This is a process 
       of understanding and feeling the everyday realities of oppression and privilege, along with the practical 
       and relational costs of these inequities. Dismantling the armor enables understanding of the systems of 
       privilege that we create and maintain and the development of empathy.  </p>
     <p></p>

    <p>Empathy is the ability to feel with another, not just for another. Empathy involves the willingness to 
      hold another’s pain alongside one’s own. This kind of empathy forms the basis of authentic relationships 
      and motivates the transformation of pain into action. As (then) Senator Obama said in 2006: “Empathy 
      is a quality of character that can change the world—one that makes you understand that your obligations to
      others extend beyond people who look like you and act like you and live in your neighborhood…. it’s 
      not always easy…. But I hope you don’t do what’s easy. I hope you do what’s hard.”  </p>
     <p></p>

    <p>I hold the hope that my scholarship and teaching can encourage doing what is hard by illustrating the 
      personal, relational, and systemic benefits of choosing that path. In my experience, as you come to 
      understand the personal responsibility inherent in your choices, you become empowered to transform pain 
      into action that reduces the negative impact of racism and social injustice for yourself and others.  </p>

         The concept of bridges is central to my professional goals and identity.  
         Bridges enable travel and communication between spaces that would 
         otherwise be difficult to reach.  We usually think about bridges 
         connecting separated physical spaces, but there are many separated social spaces, 
         particularly spaces separated by differential power and privilege.  
         These include different racial and ethnic communities; 
         communities based on other social statuses such as sexual orientation, 
         social class, gender, and ability; different academic fields; 
         and the areas of scholarship, practice and teaching within academia 
         generally and within psychology specifically.  </p>
     <p></p>

     <p>Building bridges successfully involves understanding both similarities 
        and differences.  It also involves emphasizing ways in which both
        similarities and differences can contribute to greater strength 
        through collaborations and connections.  Building bridges to connect 
        social spaces within and between communities separated by differential power and privilege involves 
        also recognizing that privilege is relative and not fixed or absolute 
        and realizing the interdependence of individual experiences and social 
        influences/systems.  Emphasizing building bridges enables me to place 
        my professional activities (teaching, scholarship, and service) in relation 
        to my goal of contributing to social justice.  </p>
     <p></p>

     <p>Four primary themes in my teaching, scholarship, and community coaction 
        that support my praxis of bridge-building are: multiple voices, 
        integrative listening, critical responsibility, and gestalt.</p>
     <ul class="joybulletarrowlist">

     <li><p><em>Multiple Voices:</em>  Psychology is increasingly acknowledging 
         that traditional practices within education, scholarship, and practice 
         have silenced, marginalized, and/or pathologized individuals and groups 
         with less social power (e.g. racial and ethnic minorities, women, working 
         class and poor people).  Asian American Studies grew out of this recognition 
         and its application to Asian American students and communities.  
         Asian American Studies is therefore founded in transforming education and 
         resisting its potential negative effects in relation to racial justice.  
         Building interdisciplinary bridges between psychology and Asian American Studies 
         has enabled me to better integrate teaching, scholarship, and practice/service 
         in the service of social justice for Asian Americans.</p>
     <p>Making space for multiple voices to resist silence and marginalization is one 
         goal that guides my teaching, scholarship, and service.  Many people in less 
         privileged positions--such as Asian Americans and other racial/ethnic minorities
         or immigrants and refugees--frequently feel silenced, particularly 
         when their needs and experiences are not reflected in the classroom, the media,
         the literature/scholarship, or the institutions, organizations, and systems 
         with which they engage.  This experience of silencing and marginalization shapes
         people's self-views and empowerment.  Each choice made by educators and scholars in 
         curriculum, pedagogy, scholarship content, and methodology contributes to these processes and          
         social consequences.  Actively inviting, encouraging, and validating diverse voices 
         is one way to resist the silencing and marginalization that less privileged people 
         frequently experience. </p>
      <p>However, it is not enough to simply invite and validate the experiential voices 
         of those who have been silenced.  To contribute to social justice, educators, 
         researchers, and social justice advocates must 
         also invite the recognition, naming, and exploration of social and historical 
         contexts and forces that contribute to silencing.  This exploration empowers those 
         in less privileged positions, such as Asian Americans, by fostering understanding of the systems 
         that may silence them and through considering ways to actively change those forces and not just 
         cope with their consequences.  This exploration also enables those in more privileged          
         positions to contribute to resisting the silence and marginalization of others through          
         understanding their privilege and utilizing it to resist oppressive forces rather than maintain them.  
         Thus, exploring multiple voices and the forces that contribute to voice or silence 
         builds bridges between those with more and less privilege  These bridges enable 
         individuals to become allies in challenging those processes and systems that silence 
         and marginalize people in different spaces and statuses.</p></li>
     <p></p>
      <li><p><em>Integrative Listening: </em>  Active listening is at the core of good education, 
         therapy, socially relevant scholarship, and social activism.  Listening involves 
         intentionally making space for shared voices and communicating one's own openness to 
         learn from others.  Engaged, integrative listening also involves actively working 
         to hear what is intended by the speaker and exploring this in relation to what is 
         actually heard (which may be quite different than what is intended). The way that 
         something is expressed by a speaker and what is actually heard by the listener is 
         inevitably filtered through the speaker's and the listener's own experiences and 
         sociocultural, historical contexts.  Exploring these filters contributes to better 
         ability to make real connections.  The simultaneous exploration of individual intention, 
         individual reception, and social systemic meaning enables the connection of the personal 
         and the social, and leads to the recognition of lived complexity and the integration of 
         multiple areas of knowing.  </p>
       <p>Integrative listening is a skill that can be developed and modeled through education, 
         scholarship, and community coaction.  Alternatively, pedagogical, methodological, 
         and organizational approaches can discourage the development of this skill 
         through emphasizing one way communication, epistemological hierarchies, 
         and authoritarian leadership.  These practices isolate individuals, groups, 
         and communities.  This isolation contributes to divisive competition and 
         continuing social oppression.</p>
       <p>Integrative listening enables teachers to hear students and students 
         to hear each other, even if they are coming from very different viewpoints.  
         It also enables scholarship to hear and be responsive to the voices of 
         individuals, groups, and communities when scholars actively listen to these voices, 
         rather than assuming they already know what is best.  Integrative listening 
         enables the kind of empathy and understanding that is essential to critical 
         thinking and effective bridge-building.  </p></li>
     <p></p>

      <li><p><em>Critical Responsibility:</em> Bridges are designed to play important 
         social and cultural (as well economic and political) roles.  But 
         bridges are only effective in creating connections if they are well used.  
         People must actively desire to make the journey across the bridge.  
         I believe that personal and social awareness is the foundation of that desire.  
         Fostering this awareness involves facilitating understanding the personal 
         effects of actions and systems, appreciating how systems are created and 
         maintained by individuals and groups making personal decisions and choices.  
         Critical thinking about knowledge production and consumption--what has or 
         has not been included--is one piece of developing this awareness when 
         connected to the personal responsibility one has in roles as both producer 
         and consumer of knowledge.  Recognizing the critical interdependence between 
         individual, institutional, structural, and socio-historical domains also 
         facilitates a sense of shared understanding and responsibility.</p></li>
     <p></p>

      <li><p><em>Gestalt:</em> Gestalt psychology centers around the idea that the 
         unified structure or whole is functionally more than the sum of its parts.  
         Bridges connect isolated areas and lead to the creation of new social systems 
         (cultures, economies, families and other social relationships).  The areas 
         connected can become, through interaction and cooperation, more than any 
         one area could be in isolation.  For example, Asian American Studies and 
         Psychology have much to offer each other, but few bridges to connect them.  
         Yet bringing together the foundations, knowledge and traditions of both 
         disciplines has been immensely rewarding for me and, I hope, for my 
         students, colleagues, and those who are familiar with my scholarship.   </p>
       <p>Similarly, connecting theory, scholarship, and practice (e.g. teaching 
         practice and pedagogy, as well as clinical practice, activism, or other 
         service activities) enables each area to benefit from the others so that 
         the sum of what is created within scholarship or offered to students, 
         clients, or disciplines is more than what could be 
         offered if these areas were disconnected and isolated from each other.  
         Much of my teaching, scholarship, and service centers on creating 
         bridges in order to create gestalts: thus, I teach about knowledge 
         production and incorporate community coaction and activism into my 
         curriculum and pedagogy; I write and present about teaching, training, 
         practice, and the process of doing research; and my community coaction 
         commitments actively make connections between the frequently disconnected 
         areas of teaching, scholarship, and service.  </p></li>
