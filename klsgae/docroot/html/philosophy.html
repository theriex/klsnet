<div class="titlediv">Teaching Philosophy</div>

     <p>My courses primarily focus on issues within my joint disciplines related to 
        multiculturalism, racialization, diversity, and social justice, with 
        secondary foci on qualitative methods and applications of 
        psychology (intervention and prevention).</p>
     <p></p>
     <p> I have always held strong ideals about teaching.  I wish to convey the 
        joy of knowledge-seeking while communicating the lived complexity of my 
        subject matter.  I aim to enable the process of critical thinking, 
        including the ability to think creatively and to question not only 
        what is known, but also how it comes to be known.  I emphasize connections 
        between disciplines, between new knowledge and what is previously known, 
        between didactic material and lived experience/application.
        I believe these connections strengthen students' ability to integrate new 
        and diverse concepts and perspectives into their existing 
        worldviews, so that different subjects are not isolated in separate 
        intellectual boxes.  This integrated structure can then be foundational 
        and applied to future learning experiences.  </p>
     <p></p>
     <p> My teaching is based in my own intellectual curiosity.  I favor a questioning approach that reflects my
        interest in and willingness to learn from others while simultaneously contributing my own ideas.  
        I work to recognize and best contribute from my areas of expertise while also recognizing
        my limitations and areas where students or colleagues may offer more to me than I may to them.
        I value an openness to complexity and an appreciation of the difficult balance 
        between the needs of the individual and the needs of the group or society.</p>
     <p></p>
     <p>The choices I make in my pedagogy reflect my goal of building bridges:</p>
     <ul class="joybulletarrowlist">
     <li><p><em>Developing learning objectives related to civic engagement and post-college preparation.</em>
        Although every course has learning objectives related to understanding the 
        content covered within the course, 'banking' knowledge and information is 
        not enough.  Goals for my courses aim at developing processes of understanding 
        and awareness that help students understand their position within their lived contexts and develop 
         skills that empower them to take action for their own success.  </p></li>
      <li><p><em>Choosing content and readings that relect multiple perspectives and invite critical thinking.</em>  
        When planning a course, I look not only at what 
        is generally presented in the field, but also at what is frequently not presented.  
        I balance these perspectives in choosing content, as I want students to have 
        a good sense of what is generally known (and expected), along with an awareness of what 
        may frequently be excluded (and why).  I aim to ensure that readings and other content 
        reflect a diversity of voices and approaches, including quantitative and 
        qualitative methods; theory, research and personal narrative; critical and 
        traditional views; and diverse representations in relation to race, 
        culture, gender, class, sexual orientation, ability and other variables 
        specifically relevant to a particular course.  I particularly attend to the 
        inclusion of voices that are silenced or frequently not included in academic 
        discourse--even discourse specifically about marginalized peoples
        (e.g., including a narrative about Arab ethnicity in my multicultural psychology course, or addressing LGBT issues within Asian American Psychology) 
        and voices that may be present in students in my class but frequently missing from course 
        material (e.g., a narrative reflecting the Hmong refugee experience in my 
        Asian American Psychology class).  I emphasize connections between the personal 
        and the social and invite critical thinking by including content that addresses both perspectives explicitly 
        and that explores influences, implications, and interventions at the individual, 
        familial, group, and social levels.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Developing a teaching style that fosters empowerment and engagement.</em>  
        The content and pedagogy of my teaching challenge 
        students conceptually, culturally, and emotionally.  I invite multiple 
        voices through making my own biases transparent so that students feel 
        they can have experiences and views that differ from my own and 
        through creating a safe space within which to explore new knowledge and 
        potentially to change one's views.  I include multiple ways of exploring, 
        expressing, and assessing oneself, and I explicitly name the cultural bases 
        of these approaches in order to facilitate connections (e.g., using a 
        talking stick or fan or shell from Native American traditions or 
        exploring how analogy or story-telling may reflect and influence 
        expression in Latino or African American cultures).  I integrate 
        community based learning experiences and discuss explicitly the 
        kinds of learning that come from (co)action and 'service.'  
        I also create assignments with multiple parts that thematically 
        build upon each other, so the whole of the students' learning is 
        greater than each assignment in isolation.  My assignments frequently
         have students produce and disseminate their own knowledge through various types of 
        research and/or self-reflection.  While I offer many resources and 
        opportunities to students, learning must ultimately be their responsibility, 
        both for themselves individually and also for creating a shared learning 
        community with others in the classroom. </p></li>
      <li><p><em>Mentoring. </em> I infuse my teaching with practices of modeling and 
        mentoring to enable students to develop their voices and abilities 
        to create connections, and to deepen their commitments to learn 
        and make positive change individually and together with others.  
        My mentoring aims to not only enhance students' research skills and 
        interests, but also to reveal the challenges of being a minority 
        psychologist and faculty member; provide support for experiences as 
        Asian American/minority/ally students; develop skills to foster allies 
        and supports; and connect students to resources to support their 
        professional development as Asian American, racial minority, or ally psychologists.  
        Similarly, I also choose to be involved with mentoring undergraduates outside of the classroom, 
        both directly and through intentional structures that involve doctoral students.  
        I recognize that many undergraduate students--particularly those from racial minority, urban, or 
        working class background--not only face profound barriers in gaining higher education 
        themselves, but also represent significant sociocultural, linguistic, 
        and economic resources for their families and communities.  If mentored and supported, 
        they can not only apply their psychological understandings to address 
        critical issues such as intergenerational conflict that affect their 
        own families and communities, but they can also contribute their 
        bilingual/bicultural strengths to health and human service agencies 
        or other settings that urgently need to become more culturally sensitive.  </p></li>
