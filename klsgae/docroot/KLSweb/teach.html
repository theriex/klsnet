     <p class="KLSpgtitle"><b>Teaching Philosophy</b></p>
     <p></p>
     <p>My courses primarily focus on issues within my joint disciplines related to 
        multiculturalism, racialization, diversity, and social justice, with 
        secondary foci on qualitative methods and applications of 
        psychology (intervention and prevention).</p>
     <p></p>
     <p> I have always held strong ideals about teaching.  I wish to convey the 
        joy of knowledge-seeking while communicating the lived complexity of my 
        subject matter.  I aim to enable the process of critical thinking, 
        including the ability to think creatively and to question not only 
        what is known, but also how it comes to be known.  I emphasize connections 
        between disciplines, between new knowledge and what is previously known, 
        between didactic material and lived experience/application.
        I believe these connections strengthen students' ability to integrate new 
        and diverse concepts and perspectives into their existing 
        worldviews, so that different subjects are not isolated in separate 
        intellectual boxes.  This integrated structure can then be foundational 
        and applied to future learning experiences.  </p>
     <p></p>
     <p> My teaching is based in my own intellectual curiosity.  I favor a questioning approach that reflects my
        interest in and willingness to learn from others while simultaneously contributing my own ideas.  
        I work to recognize and best contribute from my areas of expertise while also recognizing
        my limitations and areas where students or colleagues may offer more to me than I may to them.
        I value an openness to complexity and an appreciation of the difficult balance 
        between the needs of the individual and the needs of the group or society.</p>
     <p></p>
     <p>The choices I make in my pedagogy reflect my goal of building bridges:</p>
     <ul class="joybulletarrowlist">
     <li><p><em>Developing learning objectives related to civic engagement and post-college preparation.</em>
        Although every course has learning objectives related to understanding the 
        content covered within the course, 'banking' knowledge and information is 
        not enough.  Goals for my courses aim at developing processes of understanding 
        and awareness that help students understand their position within their lived contexts and develop 
         skills that empower them to take action for their own success.  </p></li>
      <li><p><em>Choosing content and readings that relect multiple perspectives and invite critical thinking.</em>  
        When planning a course, I look not only at what 
        is generally presented in the field, but also at what is frequently not presented.  
        I balance these perspectives in choosing content, as I want students to have 
        a good sense of what is generally known (and expected), along with an awareness of what 
        may frequently be excluded (and why).  I aim to ensure that readings and other content 
        reflect a diversity of voices and approaches, including quantitative and 
        qualitative methods; theory, research and personal narrative; critical and 
        traditional views; and diverse representations in relation to race, 
        culture, gender, class, sexual orientation, ability and other variables 
        specifically relevant to a particular course.  I particularly attend to the 
        inclusion of voices that are silenced or frequently not included in academic 
        discourse--even discourse specifically about marginalized peoples
        (e.g., including a narrative about Arab ethnicity in my multicultural psychology course, or addressing LGBT issues within Asian American Psychology) 
        and voices that may be present in students in my class but frequently missing from course 
        material (e.g., a narrative reflecting the Hmong refugee experience in my 
        Asian American Psychology class).  I emphasize connections between the personal 
        and the social and invite critical thinking by including content that addresses both perspectives explicitly 
        and that explores influences, implications, and interventions at the individual, 
        familial, group, and social levels.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Developing a teaching style that fosters empowerment and engagement.</em>  
        The content and pedagogy of my teaching challenge 
        students conceptually, culturally, and emotionally.  I invite multiple 
        voices through making my own biases transparent so that students feel 
        they can have experiences and views that differ from my own and 
        through creating a safe space within which to explore new knowledge and 
        potentially to change one's views.  I include multiple ways of exploring, 
        expressing, and assessing oneself, and I explicitly name the cultural bases 
        of these approaches in order to facilitate connections (e.g., using a 
        talking stick or fan or shell from Native American traditions or 
        exploring how analogy or story-telling may reflect and influence 
        expression in Latino or African American cultures).  I integrate 
        community based learning experiences and discuss explicitly the 
        kinds of learning that come from (co)action and 'service.'  
        I also create assignments with multiple parts that thematically 
        build upon each other, so the whole of the students' learning is 
        greater than each assignment in isolation.  My assignments frequently
         have students produce and disseminate their own knowledge through various types of 
        research and/or self-reflection.  While I offer many resources and 
        opportunities to students, learning must ultimately be their responsibility, 
        both for themselves individually and also for creating a shared learning 
        community with others in the classroom. </p></li>
      <li><p><em>Mentoring. </em> I infuse my teaching with practices of modeling and 
        mentoring to enable students to develop their voices and abilities 
        to create connections, and to deepen their commitments to learn 
        and make positive change individually and together with others.  
        My mentoring aims to not only enhance students' research skills and 
        interests, but also to reveal the challenges of being a minority 
        psychologist and faculty member; provide support for experiences as 
        Asian American/minority/ally students; develop skills to foster allies 
        and supports; and connect students to resources to support their 
        professional development as Asian American, racial minority, or ally psychologists.  
        Similarly, I also choose to be involved with mentoring undergraduates outside of the classroom, 
        both directly and through intentional structures that involve doctoral students.  
        I recognize that many undergraduate students--particularly those from racial minority, urban, or 
        working class background--not only face profound barriers in gaining higher education 
        themselves, but also represent significant sociocultural, linguistic, 
        and economic resources for their families and communities.  If mentored and supported, 
        they can not only apply their psychological understandings to address 
        critical issues such as intergenerational conflict that affect their 
        own families and communities, but they can also contribute their 
        bilingual/bicultural strengths to health and human service agencies 
        or other settings that urgently need to become more culturally sensitive.  </p></li>
      </ul>
     <p></p>
     <p class="KLSpgtitle"><b>Transformative Teaching</b></p>
     <p>Reading 'Personal theories of teaching' by Dennis Fox (1983) provided a framework to 
        consider my teaching approach.  While I saw many similarities between 
        my own theory/style and the 'Traveling' and 'Growing' theories 
        presented by Fox, there was no theory presented in that article that focused on teaching 
        as transformative.  I developed and explore here, through Fox's framework, 
        a theory of 'Transformative' teaching:</p>
     <ul class="joybulletarrowlist">
     <li><p><em>Verbs commonly used:</em> Co-create, explore, challenge, question, 
        encourage, develop, enable, grow, privilege, resist. </p></li>
      <li><p><em>The subject matter:</em>  Viewpoints, possible/multiple truths, 
        results of decisions affected by power, ways of knowing, 
        experiences to be incorporated. </p></li>
      <li><p><em>View of the student:</em>  Community builder/member, 
        explorer, co-creator, growing entities with deep roots, ally.</p>     
        <ul class="joybulletlist">
        <li><p>Community builder:  As a community member/builder, students 
           actively contribute to the building of a learning community to 
           which they give as well as from which they take.  
           Thus, students are responsible not only for their own learning 
           but also, in some ways, for the learning of others.  
           The minimum aspects of this are respect, a willingness 
           to give another the benefit of the doubt, and a minimum of 
           participation in some form.  A truly successful community, 
           however, is built through member's investment and involvement.</p></li>
        <li><p>Explorer: Students are active explorers of knowledge, 
           values, worldviews.  In education, they seek information and 
           understanding.  They are open and enthusiastic about exploring 
           new terrain, if given the necessary guidance, resources, and encouragement.  </p></li>
        <li><p>Co-creators: Students are not only explorers but 
           also co-creators of knowledge and meaning.  They actively engage 
           with and work to integrate the information and experiences they 
           encounter in the classroom.  They actively create meanings by 
           integrating new information, experiences, values, and voices 
           with their previously existing understandings.  These meanings 
           are shared through exercises, assignments, and discussions in class 
           so that each participant in the class affects the meanings created by other participants.</p></li>
        <li><p>Growing entitities with deep roots: Students are seeking not only to know 
           and explore new terrain of thinking and perceiving, but also to 
           grow and explore their own development and place in relation to 
           their self, families, and communities.  Attention to socioemotional 
           development of students within their contexts is necessary for 
           good education.  Facts are not enough.</p></li>
        <li><p>Ally:  Students either do now or will come to hold 
           the power to influence/direct the society of which they are a part.  
           They are future allies in creating social justice, resisting oppression, 
           and contributing to positive social change and maintenance.</p></li>
        </ul></li>
     <li><p><em>View of the teacher:</em>  Community organizer, guide, co-creator, 
       model, goad, nurturer/gardener, activist.</p>
        <ul class="joybulletlist">
        <li><p>Community organizer: If a community is to be built within the classroom, 
           some organization is necessary.  Teachers are both community members and the 
           primary (but rarely only) community organizer. Attention to process dynamics, 
           making space for the voice of different members, facilitating relationships 
           and connections, enabling constructive dissent, fostering shared goals and 
           directions, and structuring initiatives are part of community organizing.</p></li>
        <li><p>Guide: As a guide, a teacher explores with students the 
           terrain of the content: multiple worldviews, facts, knowledges, "lenses" 
           through which to view the world, and new experiences.  The guide calls 
           attention to new experiences and things to see.  The guide directs 
           attention to things that might be overlooked, as well as exploring why 
           we might overlook them.  The guide discusses with student explorers the 
           decision points within the journey, in an attempt to make transparent 
           the process of guiding and path building/choice, so that student 
           explorers may develop guiding skills of their own to enable future journeys.  </p></li>
        <li><p>Co-creator:  Like students, teachers are co-creators of knowledge 
           and meanings.  Teachers actively work with students to integrate and 
           create meaning from multiple sources: (a) the teacher's own understanding 
           (past and present) of the content, 
           (b) students' understanding of the content, (c) teacher's experiences 
           and worldview shaped outside the classroom, (d) students' experiences 
           and worldview shaped outside the classroom and (e) the knowing and 
           experiences shared within the classroom.  The teacher as co-creator 
           has skills that contribute to helping the process of co-creation 
           through facilitating clarifying, interpreting, and connecting the 
           different contributions.  </p></li>
        <li><p>Model: Teachers are always models, regardless of their 
           intentionality in this area.  As teachers share their understanding of 
           content, they model one possibility of what can be known.  In sharing their 
           journey to their current understanding and trying to make this process of 
           learning more transparent, they model a process: ways of learning, 
           approaching, and questioning; an openness and an understanding 
           that the knowing is incomplete, a work in progress, a journey with many 
           choices and continuing uncertainty; and a comfort with this uncertainty 
           and a willingness to not know in order to learn.</p></li>
        <li><p>Goad: Teachers act as goads, encouraging students to 
           take risks, to step outside what is comfortable and known and critically 
           examine this.  Teachers encourage students to question how they know what 
           they know and how they know it to be valuable or "true."  They goad students 
           to consider other possible ways of seeing and understanding and the 
           influences on valuing one way over another.  They goad students to 
           challenge themselves and their knowing and to contextualize both in 
           relation to sociohistorical systems both within education and outside 
           of the classroom and educational institutions.</p></li>
        <li><p>Nurturer/supporter/gardener: Growth and learning 
           frequently entail taking risks, becoming uncomfortable and, 
           sometimes, experiencing pain or other negative emotions.  
           To nurture students and enable their learning and growth, it is 
           necessary to provide both intellectual and emotional resources, 
           to acknowledge and applaud the risks and courage to face discomfort, 
           to build supports and connections with other students, to encourage 
           and appreciate learning and growth.  </p></li>
        <li><p>Activist: Education is not value-neutral.  Educational 
           institutions have been and frequently still are places that allow or 
           encourage oppression, through content, pedagogical practices, and 
           institutional policies.  The teacher as activist recognizes this 
           history and resists participation in its maintenance.  In content, one aspect of the teacher 
           as activist is making space for historically excluded knowledge and voices.  
           In relation to practice, one example of teachers as activists is 
           structuring classroom spaces and assignments to enable different 
           ways and traditions of knowing (e.g. using a talking stick for 
           discussion or an open-media project in place of a term paper).  
           Teachers as activists call attention to systems of oppression and 
           bias within education, within disciplinary fields, and within 
           the larger social context.  They must be knowledgeable about all 
           of these areas and about their own place in relation.  Teachers as 
           activists frame education itself as a way to resist oppression and 
           actively demonstrate alternatives.  </p></li>
         </ul></li>
      <li><p><em>Teaching methods:</em>  Discussions (multiple approaches), simulations, exercises 
           with unpredictable outcomes, students-teaching-students, mini-lectures/overviews that utilize
           student input and connect experiential learning with abstract didactic material.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Focus of Teaching Methods:</em>  Exploring new perspectives 
         and knowledges; experiencing as well as thinking; critically 
         examining one's own worldview; critically examining dominant "truths,"
         ways of knowing, and the processes that make these dominant; 
         integrating personal experience with new learning, information, 
         and experiences.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Methods for measuring progress:</em>  "Travel journals": 
         descriptions of what students have seen, heard, 
         and experienced including reflections on what was new, 
         previously unseen, or changed from prior context or experience.  
         Personal reflections on development and understanding. Integration of new concepts
         and knowledge with previously established knowledge and/or with personal experiences.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Explanations for failure due to student:</em>  
         (Note this can be the teacher's view or the student's view.) 
         Expectation that learning is passive, investment in banking model 
         or education, lack of motivation to explore, narrow vision of purpose of education, overly rigid or 
         overly committed to a single truth, unwilling/unable to contribute to community.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Explanations for failure due to teacher:</em> 
         (Note this can be the teacher's view or the student's view.) 
         Not sensitive to students' place in developmental journey, 
         not open enough to students' feedback, poor guide, unclear 
         or too difficult terrain to explore, poor directions or structure, 
         poor community organizing, poor model for integrating experiences, 
         not providing enough resources, not knowledgeable about sociohistorical 
         context and current influences on education content and pedagogy and the ways
         in which education historically privileges some and oppresses others.
