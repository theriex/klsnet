    <p>Micaela Curley recently graduated with her Bachelors of Arts in Psychology from the 
	University of Massachusetts, Boston.  She completed a Psychology Honors thesis utilizing the AART team data on meanings of race and ethnicity, describing colloquial understandings of race and ethnicities, their functions, and the processes by which people define them. She is continuing to work on this project, preparing a publication to report her findings that will also explore differences related to demographic variables such as gender, immigrant generation, and self-identified race. Her research interests reflect her own experiences coming from a multiracial and multiethnic background, and include race, ethnicity, social class, and gender. </p>
