<h2>Current Trainings</h2>
Currently, I provide the following workshops and trainings:
<ul class="joybulletarrowlist">

<li><em>Developing foundations for authentic conversations and relationships</em> (2 to 3 hour workshop). <br/>A workshop for groups, programs, departments, or organizations seeking to develop understanding and skills for dialoguing across differences in privilege. Goals: <ul class="joybulletsublist">
  <li>Develop conceptual foundations: shared language and frameworks for understanding oppression, privilege, and positionality
  <li>Begin an exploration of personal positionality and effects on interactions
  <li>Develop discussion guidelines to enable those conversations
  </ul>

<li><em>Foundations of Organizational Change</em> (2 to 4 hour workshop).<br/>
A workshop for groups, programs, departments, or organizations seeking to initiate or deepen an orientation towards anti-racism and social justice. Presents a continuum of approaches, inviting participants to evaluate their current context, consider challenges to improving cultural climate and anti-racist/social justice commitment. Describes social justice meanings and interventions at three ecological levels (individual, relational, organizational), and their interactions. Invites participants to develop goals and plan for next steps. Can be tailored to psychology departments and training sites with focus on possibilities for curriculum, clinical and research training, changes in policies and procedures, advocacy training, and building departmental/program structures to maintain and expand anti-racist and social justice progress.

<li><em>Strategies for Responding to micro- (and not so micro-) aggressions</em> (2 to 3 hour workshop). <br/>
A workshop for faculty, educators, and psychologists of color. Provides research-based guidance to develop strategic and effective responses to racism to promote and protect mental health for people of color, and to advance organizational change for social justice.

<li><em>Teaching Diversity Relationally</em> (6 2-hour sessions: workshop series with Grace Kim). <br/>
A workshop series to support the success of early career faculty teaching courses focused on race and culture. We aim to promote increased levels of multicultural and anti-racist responsiveness in teaching. Participants explore transformative education approaches to teaching courses related to race and culture, consider the developmental arc and relational processes of these courses, and explore specific contexts and positionalities. Participants also develop and collaboratively workshop annotated syllabi for direct application to their teaching.
