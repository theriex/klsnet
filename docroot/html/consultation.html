<ul class="joybulletarrowlist">

<li>To improve diversity climate and organizational culture by engaging in assessment, and offering insight and expertise regarding identifying challenges and issues, facilitating productive dialogues about the role of diversity and social justice in the program, modeling or presenting best practices and possible initiatives, and developing recommendations for moving forward to meet agreed upon goals (e.g. for a Clinical Training program at a University, Hospital, or other Health Service provision context). </li>

<li>To develop specific curricular, training, or extracurricular initiatives to improve diversity. For example, a tailored session might focus on personal positionality, identity and dyadic exploration exercises within the specific service provision context, use of case examples to demonstrate ways to apply knowledge, and suggestions for next steps and initiatives to continue knowledge and skills development.  </li>

<li>To address an identified problem or issue related to diversity.  Examples of issues might include critical incidents that have demonstrated a lack of understanding from advisors or student service professionals; tensions among co-workers or within a working unit related to microaggressions or bias.</li>
